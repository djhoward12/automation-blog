Each week the A&I team completes code challenges. This week we will be doing the following: 

*Write a function that returns the verses to the '12 days of Christmas'. Sounds easy right? The function must take two arguments- start day and end day, and return a list of the verses as a string for each day.*

Most A&I members will attempt the exercise in python, but I decided to try it out in rust. My code is below. 

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    xmas_song(0, 12);
}
fn xmas_song(start: u32, end: u32) {
    let days = vec!["1st", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", "seventh", "eigth", "ninth", "tenth", "eleventh", "twelth"];
    let gifts =  vec!["A partridge in a pear tree", "two turtle doves", "three french hens", "four calling birds", "five gold rings",
    "Six geese a laying", "Seven swans a swimming", "Eight maids a milking", "Nine ladies dancing", "Ten lords a leaping", "Eleven pipers piping",
    "12 drummers drumming"];

   
    let mut count = 0;
    let mut _y = count;
    for _x in start..end {
        println!("On the {} day of Christmas, My true love gave to me {}", days[_x], gifts[_x]);
        count += 1;
        _y = count - 1;
        while _y > 0 {
            _y -= 1;
            println!("{}", gifts[_y]);
        }
    } 

}
{% endhighlight %}
