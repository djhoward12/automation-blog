**Stephen Follett asked for the ability to ssh from Netbox directly to a network device. We thought it was a great idea and figured out how to make it happen. When you log into Netbox now you will see an Orange SSH button on the top right of a router device type. Currently only doing this for routers, but plan to add switches soon.**

**The coolest part of the story was how long it would take to move all 64 discs from one pile to the next.**

*In particular, moving a tower of 64 disks requires 2**64 - 1 =
 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 individual moves. Thus, even at the impressive rate
of one move per second, the monks at Benares will be at work for approximately
 billion years*

**I wrote the solutions to the problem in python and rust.** 

{% highlight python %}
def hanoi(discs, src, tmp, dest):
    if discs == 1:
       print ('Move disc 1 from peg {} to peg {}.'.format(src, dest) )
       return
    
    hanoi(discs - 1, src, dest, tmp)
    print ('Move disc {} from peg {} to peg {}.'.format(discs, src, dest) )  
    hanoi(discs - 1, tmp, src, dest)

    
discs = int(input('Enter the number of discs: '))
hanoi(discs, 'A', 'B', 'C')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight rust %}
use std::io;

fn main() {

    println!("Please input the number of discs:");

    let mut discs = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut discs)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let discs: u32 = discs.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You entered: {} discs", discs);

   hanoi(discs, "A", "B", "C");
}

fn hanoi(discs: u32, src: &str, tmp: &str, dest: &str) {
    
    
    if discs == 1 {
        println!("Move disc 1 from peg {} to peg {}",src, dest);
        return;
    }
    hanoi(discs -1, src, dest, tmp);
    println!("Move disc {} from peg {} to peg {}", discs, src, dest);
    hanoi(discs -1, tmp, src, dest);

}
